drone
==========

A port of SparkleBot for plug.dj. This bot uses https://github.com/TATDK/plugapi as its API dependency.  This API differs significantly from the previous atomjack/chrisinajar versions.  Otherwise, everything's included except node - just remove the `.sample` from the config and database files, replace the DB values with your own, and everything should work.

Known Issues
=============
* There are some issues when trying to @mention people with spaces in their usernames - Plug has prohibited anyone from changing TO these names, but existing ones are still out in the wild.
* The bot will occasionally disconnect from Plug.DJ - it'll still be able to send and receive chat messages but will not receive any other events.
